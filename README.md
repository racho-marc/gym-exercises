# Using the ExerciseDB API and YouTube API from RapidAPI.com
I built a page where I can quickly look up exercises to incorporate into my workout routine.
With YouTube API, I can search for exercises that match specific workouts and pull videos onto the page.

I used React, Material UI, React Horizontal Scrolling Menu, React Loader Spinner, and React Router DOM.
